THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. 

This is my own personal project to make myself more comfortable with javax.swing.

It's called WizardGame, and the main idea is having the user play as a witch or wizard, using the 4 basic elements air, water, earth and fire to make spell combinations to defeat their enemies.

Right now the only feature complete part is the character creator, in which the player can customize their character by choosing gender, hair color, skin color, robe color and eye color. 

I plan on adding many different types of enemies, adding some different environments, finishing the spell combinations, adding cutscenes and vicotry conditions.
